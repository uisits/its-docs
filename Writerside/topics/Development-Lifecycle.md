# Development Lifecycle

Our goal is to provide top quality applications that are bug free, easy to use and that makes our end user's work easy and joy to work with.  
ITS follows specific standards and rules during developing and post deployment of the applications. These rules are to be followed for every project (unless some steps can be skipped based on project requirements).

### Project Overview
The development team specializes in web and mobile application development. The team's primary objective is to create applications for university use. Technologies employed include PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Vue, MySQL, Oracle, and integration with various APIs. The team adopts the Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach to expedite the development and deployment processes.

**SDLC Model: Rapid Application Development (RAD)**  
RAD emphasizes iterative development, focusing on prototyping and user feedback to expedite application delivery.

#### Phases in RAD
1. Requirements Planning

    Gather and analyze user requirements for the application.
    Conduct meetings with stakeholders, faculty, and end-users to identify and document functional and non-functional requirements.
    Create user stories, use cases, and wireframes to visualize the application's functionalities.
    Prioritize features based on user feedback and project scope.

2. User Design

    Develop the user interface based on gathered requirements.
    Create mockups, UI prototypes, and design specifications.
    Collaborate closely with UX designers and stakeholders for iterative improvements.
    Validate designs with end-users for usability and intuitive navigation.

3. Construction

    Develop and build the application using chosen technologies.
    Use Git and GitHub for version control to manage collaborative development.
    Divide tasks among team members based on expertise (e.g., backend development in PHP/Laravel, frontend in Vue).
    Conduct code reviews and ensure coding standards adherence.

4. Testing

    Ensure the application meets quality standards and user expectations.
    Conduct unit tests for individual components/modules.
    Perform integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between different parts of the application.
    Implement user acceptance testing (UAT) involving stakeholders and end-users for validation.

5. Deployment

    Prepare the application for production and deployment.
    Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistent deployment environments.
    Implement a load balancer for efficient distribution of traffic.
    Monitor deployment process and address any deployment-related issues.

6. Feedback and Evaluation

    Gather feedback post-deployment for further improvements.
    Establish feedback channels (surveys, feedback forms) for users and stakeholders.
    Evaluate application performance, usability, and user satisfaction.
    Plan and prioritize enhancements or additional features based on feedback received.


#### Tools and Technologies

| Action          | Tool                               |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Version Control | Git, Github                        |
| Development     | PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Vue etc. |
| Databases       | MySql, Oracle, SqlServer.          |
| Deployment      | Docker, Vmware                     |


> Team Collaboration
> 
> Maintain clear communication channels through regular meetings and communication tools (Slack, Teams).
> Utilize project management tools (GitHub Boards, GitHub Issue Tracker) for task tracking, assignment, and progress monitoring.
> Encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and cross-training among team members.

#### Conclusion
The outlined SDLC, adopting the RAD approach, empowers the team to efficiently develop, test, and deploy applications for university purposes. By leveraging modern technologies, collaborative tools, and iterative development practices, the team aims to deliver high-quality applications meeting user requirements within rapid development cycles.
